# TeachCraft - An AI-assisted quiz creation tool for teachers

This project is inspired, or perhaps more accurately, a personal response to the stupidity of the current state of vibe coding, namely the "TeachFlow" project trending on Threads. I have no doubt that the intentions behind that project were good, but the execution was a disaster in terms of code quality, maintainability, and information security in my opinion.

TeachCraft is a web application built using FastAPI, designed to do the same thing as TeachFlow, but actually "Craft" by a real developer and not some random AI agents lead by a non-competent, inexperienced, and frankly, irresponsible "prompt engineer" (calling them developers would be an insult to real developers ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ).
